# Jest Crash Course Examples

Jest is a JS framework specifically used for writing tests for JS.\
This repo contains some exercises instructed from videos so that the person is more familiar with testing in JS.\
This repo is for learning and practice purpose only.

## :smile: **Getting Started/Brief Description**

Test suite is a file that contains tests for JS, usually written as `something.test.js`.\
With a simple script `"test": "jest"` inside `package.json`, all test suites will be run and results can be viewed in the command line (using VSC is recommended).
